# ChallengeProject-TeaCozy
#### PROJECT SCOPE
This is my **Codecademy Off-Platform Project: _Tea Cozy_"**

<p>The scope of the project was to build a webpage according to the given specifications.
The specs define a webpage of constant width.<p>
<p>After the specs were satisfied I experimented with responsive design
and added queries for different screens.
This means that I intentionally altered the layout of the page.</p>
<p>My goal was to experiment and make components visible in smaller screens
and not to present the ideal user experience.<br>
This is a project to practice and learn.</p>
